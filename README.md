## Overview
This repository is my driver development project for Tiva Launchpad TM4C123GH6PM. The repository includes driver software for four functionaities
-GPIO
-SPI
-I2C
-UART
The driver software accesses the control registers and program them with given parameters. The driver is capable of initializing the module, and perform simple I/O. Simple applications that call the APIs to do I/O are also included in the repo.
## Acknowledgement
In the development of the project, I referenced the Udemy course *Mastering Microcontroller with Embedded Driver Development* and *Tiva TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller Data Sheet*. The Udemy course can be accessed using the following link

The drivers are still under development. More advanced functionalities are to be implemented in the software.

The description of each driver is written separately in their directories.
